pvalue and null hypothesis



f-statistics

the lower the f statictics  is better 


ols assumtions

1 linearity:   as to be a relation with a line, or it can be done a transformation to get that line





2 no endogenety:  e yo forgot  to include a  relevant variable (ommited  variables bias)




3 normality  and  homoscedasticity:    change to get a line by using log  of x or y  or  booth  log -log model   (elasticity)


4 no autocoorelation   detetion -> durbin-watson more than 2 no autocoorelation     below 1 and  above 3 alarm     no remedy...  it's used  autoregressive model  moving average model (time series data)



5  no multicolliniarity    strong relation   how to fix  get rid of one variable  transforn two into one
